"""Hermes local-agent benchmark runner for Jikji.

This module executes Hermes in non-interactive mode against an external eval set
and records enough evidence to compare raw filesystem search with Jikji-assisted
search. It is intentionally conservative about no-leak runs: expected paths must
come from an eval set outside the target root, and generated eval files inside the
root are rejected unless the caller explicitly opts out.
