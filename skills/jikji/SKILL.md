# Jikji Local File Discovery Skill

Use this skill when the user asks you to find, identify, compare, or verify local
files/documents under an explicit root path. Jikji is for agent discovery, not
physical file organization.

## Safety contract

- Never move, rename, delete, or reorganize source files.
- Never scan all drives by default; require or infer a bounded explicit root.
- Treat `.jikji/doc_text/` as sensitive because it may contain extracted document
  text.
- Do not commit `.jikji/` or `000_JIKJI_AGENT_MAP.md` unless the user explicitly
  wants generated artifacts tracked.
- Open original files only for final verification after Jikji has returned
  likely paths.

## Fast agent protocol

Default to `brief` for autonomous work:

```bash
jikji brief /explicit/root "natural language file clue" --top-k 10 --json
```

Use `search` when you only need ranked candidates:

```bash
jikji search /explicit/root "natural language file clue" --top-k 10 --json
```

Interpretation:

- `candidates[].path` is the relative path to return or inspect.
- `evidence` and `matched_terms` explain why the candidate was ranked.
- `candidate_folders` gives folder context.
- `commands` contains fallback searches if the candidate list is insufficient.
- Preserve paths exactly as returned.

## Direct handoff rule

If the candidate list is plausible, do **not** perform a new broad `find`, `ls`,
`rg`, or manual filesystem crawl. Use Jikji's ranked paths directly and verify
only the top candidates when needed.

This is the intended speed benefit: Jikji has already done the repeated file-map
work before the agent receives the task.

## Prepare/refresh/admin commands

`brief` and `search` can auto-prepare a missing explicit root. Use these admin
commands when the user asks for setup, refresh, diagnostics, or cleanup:

```bash
jikji prepare /explicit/root --json
jikji refresh /explicit/root --json
jikji doctor /explicit/root --json
jikji map /explicit/root
jikji clean /explicit/root --dry-run --json
jikji clean /explicit/root --json
```

## Fallback route

Only when `brief`/`search` is empty or clearly wrong:

```bash
cat /explicit/root/000_JIKJI_AGENT_MAP.md
cat /explicit/root/.jikji/agent_routes.md
rg "keyword" /explicit/root/.jikji/*.jsonl
rg "keyword" /explicit/root/.jikji/doc_text
rg "keyword" /explicit/root --glob '!**/.jikji/**'
```

Use parser-extracted `.jikji/doc_text/` for PDF/HWP/HWPX/Office document bodies.
Search native text-like files in original locations as a final fallback.

## Evaluation

To test whether Jikji helps on a root:

```bash
jikji eval-generate /explicit/root --cases 80 --json
jikji eval /explicit/root --json
```

For actual-agent comparison with Hermes:

```bash
jikji hermes-skill-install --json
jikji hermes-bench /benchmark/root \
  --eval-set /external/eval.jsonl \
  --modes raw,jikji-fast,jikji-direct \
  --candidate-top-k 10 --skills jikji --json
```

`raw` means no Jikji. `jikji-fast` gives Hermes a compact map-first handoff.
`jikji-direct` measures the tool/skill behavior where the agent accepts Jikji's
ranked candidates without an extra exploratory chat turn.
