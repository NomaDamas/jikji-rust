# Public benchmark catalog for Jikji

Jikji is a non-destructive file-map and route layer for local agents. The most
useful benchmarks are therefore file-level or filesystem-level tasks, not only
chunk retrieval tasks.

## Recommended order

| Benchmark | Best use | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| HippoCamp | Personal-computer style file search and agent QA | Full dataset is large; some tasks evaluate final QA more than retrieval |
| EDiTh / Véracier Industries | Enterprise PDFs, scanned/searchable/mixed formats, multilingual, multi-file answers | Public archive is ~1.5GB and only a few answer-key questions are explicit file-list retrieval |
| MIRACL-VISION materialized docs | Multilingual file-level retrieval regression | Materialized as Markdown, so raw lexical search is strong |
| BEIR materialized docs | Wide deterministic IR regression | Materialized as Markdown; not a parser stress test |
| SDS KoPub VDR | Korean public PDF page-level retrieval | Corpus parquet is very large; needs page-to-file conversion |
| UniDoc-Bench | Large PDF page/QA stress test | Multimodal/page-centric; needs file-level conversion |
| docx-corpus | DOCX parser/indexing scale stress | No retrieval QA; needs synthetic/label-derived eval |

## EDiTh bounded run

Jikji includes an EDiTh adapter:

```bash
jikji edith-summary .benchmarks/edith_public --json
jikji edith-suite .benchmarks/edith_public_run \
  --cases 3 --max-docs 42 --top-k 10 \
  --max-download-bytes 2000000000 --json
```

The adapter downloads only metadata first. For `edith-suite`, it stream-extracts
only selected PDFs from the public archive instead of storing the 1.5GB tarball.
The stream is bounded by `--max-download-bytes` and `--no-docs` can be used for
metadata/eval-set inspection without running a corpus benchmark.

Most recent bounded result on this workstation:

```text
Dataset           Mode   Cases  Hit@1   Hit@3   Hit@5   Hit@10  SetR@5  MRR
EDiTh PDF subset  raw    3      0.3333  0.6667  0.6667  0.6667  0.4000  0.4444
EDiTh PDF subset  jikji  3      0.3333  1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  0.6667  0.6667
```

Actual Hermes agent on the same subset:

```text
Mode          Cases  Hit@5   Hit@10  Seconds  Avg sec/case
raw           3      1.0000  1.0000  152.777  50.926
hermes+jikji  3      1.0000  1.0000  120.852  40.284
```

Interpretation: EDiTh is more realistic than Markdown-only corpora for Jikji's
parser/cache/route-layer purpose, but the current bounded file-list subset is
small. Treat it as a smoke benchmark and use HippoCamp/full EDiTh variants for
stronger claims.
