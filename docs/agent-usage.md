# Using Jikji from a Local Agent

For a full cross-agent installation and skill attachment guide, see
[`docs/agent-installation.md`](agent-installation.md).

Install from a checkout:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Attach the skill once:

```bash
jikji agent-skill-install --agent all --json
jikji skill-export --dest /path/to/unknown-agent/skills/jikji/SKILL.md --json
```

After that, a local agent should select the Jikji skill automatically whenever a
user asks it to find local files, folders, filenames, metadata, or document
contents under a bounded root. For agents without a skill directory, paste
`jikji skill-export` output into their persistent instructions.

The install command also starts a low-impact background prepare for common
Documents/Downloads/Desktop/cloud roots that exist on the computer. Use
`--foreground-prepare` to wait for it, `--prepare-root PATH` to add a root, or
`--no-prepare` to skip post-install indexing.

Image files contribute lightweight local metadata (format, dimensions, selected
EXIF datetime when available). Text inside images/scanned PDFs is indexed only
when `tesseract` is installed on the agent's PATH; check
`jikji doctor ROOT --json` and inspect `image_support.ocr_active`.

Agent flow:

1. Start with the tool-first command. It auto-prepares an explicit root when
   the instant index is missing:

```bash
.venv/bin/jikji brief /path/to/folder "natural language file clue" --top-k 10 --json
.venv/bin/jikji search /path/to/folder "natural language file clue" --top-k 10 --json
```

Use `brief` by default for autonomous agent work because it includes the ranked
paths, evidence snippets, relevant folder context, and fallback commands in one
compact payload. Use `search` for a smaller ranked-candidate-only response.

2. If the result is empty or clearly insufficient, inspect the route guides and
   indexes:

```bash
cat /path/to/folder/.jikji_agent_map.md
cat /path/to/folder/.jikji/agent_routes.md
rg "keyword" /path/to/folder/.jikji/*.jsonl
```

3. Search parser-extracted document text only when needed:

```bash
rg "keyword" /path/to/folder/.jikji/doc_text
```

4. Search native text files in the original tree as a final fallback:

```bash
rg "keyword" /path/to/folder --glob '!**/.jikji/**'
```

Do not move, rename, delete, or reorganize source files while using Jikji for
search.

Recommended `.gitignore` for indexed roots that are also Git repositories:

```gitignore
.jikji/
.jikji_agent_map.md
```


## Evaluate search quality

After preparing a root, generate and run a local search eval set:

```bash
jikji eval-generate /path/to/folder --cases 80 --json
jikji eval /path/to/folder --json
```

Use `.jikji/eval/eval_report.json` to compare hit@k and MRR before/after map or
indexing changes.


## Direct handoff mode

For the clearest agent-speed benefit, treat Jikji as a tool handoff: call
`jikji brief` or `jikji search`, accept plausible ranked candidates, and avoid a
new broad filesystem crawl. The Hermes benchmark mode `jikji-direct` measures
this behavior against `raw` agent search.
