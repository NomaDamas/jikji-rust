# Rust Port Parity Report

Generated for Task 8 of `.omo/plans/rust-port-workplan.md`.

Evidence file: `.omo/evidence/rust-port-workplan/task-08-parity-benchmark.txt`

## Scope

The final parity harness compares the Python reference at
`/Users/jeffrey/Projects-dev/jikji` with the Rust release binary
`target/release/jikji` on:

- checked-in golden fixture scenarios under `tests/golden`
- one generated temporary corpus
- `prepare`, `search`, and `find` wall-clock timings
- Rust benchmark/report command smoke for `eval-generate`, `bench-run`, and
  `bench-analyze`
- mutation failure proof for a changed golden JSON candidate order/key

## Result

The final parity harness result is **PASS**. Contract-sensitive CLI outcomes,
required generated artifact presence, required schema fields, search ranking,
find behavior, doctor behavior, clean JSON keys, clean safety, mutation failure
proof, and benchmark/report command smoke all passed.

The run recorded wall-clock timings for `prepare`, `search`, and `find` only as
bounded local measurements from that invocation. They are not a claimed
performance guarantee or faster-than assertion.

Contract failures: none.

Generated artifact policy:

- Hard failures: missing required generated artifact classes, missing required
  artifact directories, malformed generated JSON/JSONL, missing documented
  fields, CLI JSON key differences, and search/find candidate-order differences.
- Hard failures: parser cache text files missing when Python generated them, or
  empty Rust parser cache text where Python generated non-empty cache text.
- Intentional non-parity: generated Markdown prose and validated generated
  JSON/JSONL prose may differ after required artifact presence, documented
  schema fields, and search/find behavior pass.
- Intentional non-parity: exact `.jikji/doc_text/sha256_*.txt` cache content may
  differ across parser implementations after required cache-file presence,
  non-empty text generation, documented JSON schemas, and search/ranking
  behavior pass.
- Intentional non-parity: `.jikji/wiki/sources/<stem>-<hash>.md` suffix hashes
  are implementation-specific, so parity compares semantic source stems and
  counts rather than exact filename hashes.

## Rationale

The Python implementation remains the reference for public CLI JSON envelopes,
ranking order, required artifact presence, non-empty parser cache generation,
and documented generated artifact schemas. Implementation-specific Markdown
wording, validated generated JSON prose, exact parser cache text bytes, and wiki
source slug hash suffixes are recorded as intentional non-parity only after the
contract checks pass because they are not user-facing contracts in
`docs/schema.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
