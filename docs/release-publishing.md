# Release And Publishing

Jikji releases use GitHub Actions for cross-OS binaries and crates.io trusted
publishing. The primary publish path does not use a long-lived `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`
secret.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes to `main` across
Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. It checks formatting, clippy, workspace tests
excluding the internal `jikji-parity` crate, Python golden fixture capture,
Rust golden parity, `cargo doc` smoke, and a real CLI command smoke.

## GitHub Release Artifacts

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs for `v*.*.*` tags and manual dispatches.
It builds and uploads:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

Each archive is produced by `scripts/release/build-artifacts.sh` and has a
matching `.sha256` file. Local maintainers can inspect the artifact shape
without compiling by running:

```bash
bash scripts/release/build-artifacts.sh --dry-run
```

## crates.io Trusted Publishing

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` is the primary crates.io publish path. It grants
`id-token: write`, uses `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1`, and passes the
temporary trusted-publishing token to `cargo publish`. The workflow verifies the
workspace package tarballs with real `cargo package` verification before
publishing. Release publishing must run from a clean checkout; `--allow-dirty`
is only for local package-shape inspection while a change is still under review.

Before the first publish, configure every publishable crate on crates.io with a
trusted publisher entry for this repository:

- repository owner/name: `NomaDamas/jikji-rust`
- workflow file: `publish.yml`
- environment: `crates-io`
- crate list: `jikji-core`, `jikji-media-bridge`, `jikji-parser`,
  `jikji-search`, `jikji-agent`, `jikji-index`, `jikji-cli`

The internal `jikji-parity` and `jikji-bench` crates have `publish = false` and
are intentionally excluded. Benchmark parity is driven by Python evaluator
scripts under `tools/parity/`, not by a published Rust benchmark crate.

## Local Publish Dry Runs Before First Release

`cargo package --workspace --exclude jikji-parity --exclude jikji-bench` is the local package-shape
gate and should pass before release. For publish dry-runs before the first
crates.io release, only the first dependency crate can be fully proven against
the live registry:

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run -p jikji-core --allow-dirty
```

Dependent crates such as `jikji-parser`, `jikji-search`, and `jikji-cli` depend
on the workspace versions of earlier Jikji crates. Until those versions exist in
the crates.io index, their local `cargo publish --dry-run` commands are expected
to fail with a registry dependency-resolution error. That failure is an external
publish-order blocker, not proof that the dependent crate package is invalid.
The trusted workflow publishes crates in dependency order so each later crate
sees the earlier crate version in the registry.

Token-secret publishing is only a manual break-glass fallback. If trusted
publishing is unavailable, a maintainer may run `cargo publish -p <crate>` from a
clean checkout with a scoped local cargo token, following the same crate order
listed above. Do not add a `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` secret to the trusted workflow.
